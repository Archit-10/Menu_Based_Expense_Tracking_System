<h2>Challenges and Future Directions</h2>

<h3>Challenges Faced</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Accurate Expense Distribution:</strong>
        <p>Handling expenses with varied participant distributions was essential to ensure accuracy. Balancing each individual's owed or paid amount against others demanded precise computation.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>User Interface Limitations:</strong>
        <p>Keeping the interface simple meant restricting user interaction to text-based prompts. Maintaining ease of use while providing clear instructions was a constant focus.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong>
        <p>Since the current system only writes data upon exit, handling interruptions in real-time data saving could improve reliability.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Directions</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong>
        <p>Adding a GUI would enhance user experience by allowing interaction through buttons and menus, making PennyWise more intuitive and visually accessible.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Synchronization:</strong>
        <p>Implementing real-time data saving would prevent accidental data loss. Integration with cloud storage could enable seamless collaboration across devices.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Reporting and Analysis:</strong>
        <p>Enhanced data output with summary reports, visual charts, and in-depth analysis could help users gain insights into spending patterns and balances.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Compatibility:</strong>
        <p>Developing a mobile-friendly version would provide users with on-the-go expense tracking, ideal for group events and trips.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning for Predictive Insights:</strong>
        <p>Integrating basic machine learning could allow PennyWise to offer budgeting suggestions based on historical spending patterns, adding value for frequent users.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
